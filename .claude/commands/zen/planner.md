I need help breaking down this complex project or idea into manageable, structured steps. Please use the Zen MCP server's planner tool for step-by-step planning: $ARGUMENTS

This is perfect for adding new features to existing systems, scaling up system design, migration strategies, architectural planning, and any complex project that needs systematic breakdown with branching and revision capabilities.
