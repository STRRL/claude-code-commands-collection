I want you to critically challenge this statement or approach instead of automatically agreeing. Please use the Zen MCP server's challenge tool to encourage thoughtful reassessment: $ARGUMENTS

This tool wraps your input with instructions for critical thinking and honest analysis, helping prevent automatic agreement and encouraging deeper evaluation of ideas, especially when they might be wrong.
