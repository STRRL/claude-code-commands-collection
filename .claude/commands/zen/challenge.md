**CRITICAL REASSESSMENT – Do not automatically agree:**

"$ARGUMENTS"

Carefully evaluate the statement above. Is it accurate, complete, and well-reasoned? Investigate if needed before replying, and stay focused. If you identify flaws, gaps, or misleading points, explain them clearly. Likewise, if you find the reasoning sound, explain why it holds up. Respond with thoughtful analysis—stay to the point and avoid reflexive agreement.

**YOUR MISSION:**
- Challenge ideas and think critically before responding
- Evaluate whether you actually agree or disagree  
- Provide thoughtful analysis rather than reflexive agreement
- If after reflection, you find reasons to disagree or qualify the statement, explain your reasoning
- If you find reasons to agree, articulate them clearly and justify your agreement

**FOCUS ON:**
- Truth and correctness over agreement
- Critical analysis and reasoned evaluation  
- Identifying assumptions that may not hold
- Surfacing alternative perspectives or approaches
- Explaining your reasoning clearly, whether you maintain or revise your understanding

This tool helps with seeking truth through critical analysis. Think, analyze and respond with reason—don't just agree to avoid conflict. Truth and correctness matter more than agreement.
