I need diverse expert opinions from multiple AI models on this technical proposal or decision. Please use the Zen MCP server's consensus tool to gather different perspectives: $ARGUMENTS

This tool supports stance steering (for/against/neutral) and structured decision-making. Perfect for evaluating architectural decisions, technology choices, migration strategies, or any situation where multiple expert opinions would help make better decisions.
