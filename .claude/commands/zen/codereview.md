I need a comprehensive code review with prioritized feedback and severity levels. Please use the Zen MCP server's codereview tool to perform systematic investigation: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool guides through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step to ensure thorough code examination, issue identification, and quality assessment. Perfect for security reviews, bug detection, performance analysis, and overall code quality improvement.
