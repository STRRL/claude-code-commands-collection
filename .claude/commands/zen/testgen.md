I need comprehensive test generation with thorough edge case coverage. Please use the Zen MCP server's testgen tool for systematic test creation: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool guides through systematic investigation of code functionality, critical paths, edge cases, and integration points across multiple steps before generating comprehensive tests with realistic failure mode analysis. Perfect for creating robust test suites that cover both happy paths and error conditions.
