I need extended reasoning and deep analysis on this topic. Please use the Zen MCP server's thinkdeep tool to get a second opinion that augments your thinking, challenges assumptions, identifies edge cases, and provides alternative perspectives: $ARGUMENTS

This is perfect for complex architectural decisions, debugging tricky issues, analyzing potential problems, or any situation where deeper thinking and multiple perspectives would be valuable.
