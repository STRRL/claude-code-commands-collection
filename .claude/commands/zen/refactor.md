I need comprehensive refactoring analysis with top-down decomposition strategy. Please use the Zen MCP server's refactor tool for systematic investigation: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool enforces systematic investigation of code smells, decomposition opportunities, and modernization possibilities across multiple steps. Perfect for breaking down large classes, improving code structure, eliminating technical debt, and strategic code improvement.
