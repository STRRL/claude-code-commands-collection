I need detailed call-flow mapping and dependency tracing for this code. Please use the Zen MCP server's tracer tool to generate analysis prompts: $ARGUMENTS

This tool creates structured analysis requests for precision execution flow or dependency mapping. Perfect for understanding how methods are used, tracing data flow, mapping dependencies, or analyzing call chains in complex systems.
