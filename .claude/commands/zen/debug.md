I need systematic debugging help to find the root cause of this issue. Please use the Zen MCP server's debug tool for step-by-step investigation: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool enforces a structured investigation process with methodical code examination, evidence collection, and hypothesis formation across multiple steps. Perfect for complex bugs, intermittent issues, performance problems, or any situation requiring systematic root cause analysis.
