I need comprehensive validation of staged/unstaged git changes before committing. Please use the Zen MCP server's precommit tool to review changes: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool guides through systematic investigation of git changes, repository status, and file modifications across multiple steps before providing expert validation. Perfect for ensuring changes meet requirements, preventing regressions, and catching issues before they reach the repository.
