I need a comprehensive security audit with OWASP-based assessment and compliance evaluation. Please use the Zen MCP server's secaudit tool for systematic security analysis: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool guides through methodical security investigation steps with forced pauses between each step to ensure thorough vulnerability assessment, security pattern analysis, and compliance verification. Perfect for identifying security vulnerabilities, ensuring OWASP Top 10 compliance, and comprehensive security reviews.
