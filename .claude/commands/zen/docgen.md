I need comprehensive documentation generation with complexity analysis and gotcha identification. Please use the Zen MCP server's docgen tool for systematic documentation creation: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow tool guides through systematic investigation of code structure, function complexity, and documentation needs across multiple steps before generating comprehensive documentation that includes algorithmic complexity, call flow information, and unexpected behaviors that developers should know about.
